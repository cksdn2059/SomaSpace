SomaSpace
SomaSpace is an interactive experience that helps people slow down, breathe, and reconnect with their body through gentle movement and responsive visuals. The system reacts in real time, turning stillness into calm animations and guiding users toward a more grounded state.


Features
•	Real time motion tracking
•	Ambient visuals that respond to presence and stillness
•	A quiet space for self regulation and reflection
Purpose
SomaSpace explores how simple movement and visual feedback can support emotional balance and create moments of calm in busy environments.

Project Focus
This project is part of my thesis work in Human Experience Design Interaction. It studies how embodied interaction can help people notice their state, slow down, and feel more connected to themselves.
